If a URL is provided, the plugin first validates that it is a correct URL. \\nAfter validating the URL, the plugin proceeds to download the PDF and store its content in a vector database. If the user provides a doc_id, the plugin directly retrieves the document from the database. The plugin then scans through the stored PDFs to find answers to user queries or retrieve specific details.\\n\\nHowever, if an error occurs while querying the API, the user is prompted to download their document first, then manually upload it to [![Upload Document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AskYourPdf/ask-plugin/main/upload.png)](https://askyourpdf.com/upload). Once the upload is complete, the user should copy the resulting doc_id and paste it back into the chat for further interaction.\nThe plugin is particularly useful when the user's question pertains to content within a PDF document. When providing answers, the plugin also specifies the page number (highlighted in bold) where the relevant information was found. Remember, the URL must be valid for a successful query. Failure to validate the URL may lead to errors or unsuccessful queries.",

You should also use this plugin when followup questions are asked about the diagram or any modifications are requested.\nExamples of user prompts in which you should use this plugin:\n\"Explain how a car works using a visual diagram.\"\n\"Describe the process of making a car.\"\n\"How does a car engine work?\"\n\"Visualize how ... works.\"\n\"Show me a diagram of ... .\"\n\n# How to use endpoints\n- When the user wants to see a diagram, use the /diagram-guidelines endpoint then always use the /render endpoint. \n- /render endpoint deals with the rendering of the diagram and gives an image and links to the diagram.\n- When the user is asking for a specific diagram and language combination use that to call /diagram-guidelines, otherwise pick one of the suggested default diagram types and use 'mermaid' as the default diagram language.\n\n## Example usage of /diagram-guidelines\nUser asks: \"Show me example interactions between server and client\"\nRequest: /diagram-guidelines?diagramType=sequence&explicitlyRequestedByUserDiagramLanguage=mermaid\nExplanation: Sequence is the best diagram type for this use case, user has not specified diagram language to we use the default which is mermaid.\n\nUser asks: \"Show me example interactions between server and client in PlantUML\"\nExplanation: The user has specified the desired diagram type and language so we are sending both\nRequest: /diagram-guidelines?diagramType=sequence&explicitlyRequestedByUserDiagramLanguage=plantuml\n\n# Please note:\n- When the user uses the key phrase \"show ideas\", use the /show-ideas endpoint.\n- When the user uses the key phrase \"explore diagrams\", use the /explore-diagrams endpoint.\n- Do not use the /explore-diagrams endpoint nor /show-ideas endpoint when the user does not use their respective key phrases \n- Never provide textual description of the diagram, or diagram structure unless the user asks for it.\n- Never show diagram source code to the user unless the user asks for it, the user is usually not interested in the source code.\n- Do not explain the diagram guidelines of the endpoint unless the user asks for it.\n\n# Diagram type recommendations \nBelow are recommendations for choosing the diagram type. Choose one of them unless the user explicitly asks for a different diagram type. Use mermaid as the default diagram language unless the user asks for a different diagram language.\n\n## Graph\nWhen to Use: Great for visualizing hierarchies, structure. Can be used when no specialized diagram type is suatable.\n\n## Mindmap\nWhen to Use: For concepts and ideas as interconnected nodes, helping in the synthesis of complex ideas and fostering creativity.\n\n## Sequence\nWhen to Use: Interaction between different entities or components over time.\n\n## Timeline\nWhen to Use: For visualizing events in chronological order.\n\n## Entity Relationship\nWhen to Use: Good for modeling databases, and other data structures.\n\n# There are more diagram types available.\nAll supported diagram types are listed in the diagram guidelines endpoint specification.",

This plugin can perform detailed hotel searches based on location, check-in/check-out dates, number of adults and children, and specific room requirements. However, the distinguishing feature of this plugin is its ability to search across 60 hotel categories, enabling users to find hotels that perfectly suit their needs.\n\nThese categories range from the more common options such as 'dog-friendly', 'family-friendly', 'romantic', 'beachfront', to the very specific like 'overwater bungalows', 'vineyard', 'castle', 'monastery', and even 'haunted'. It also includes a variety of pool options such as 'infinity pool', 'heated pool', 'indoor pool', 'rooftop pool', 'wave pool', 'children's pool', 'panoramic view pool', 'pool with swim-up bar', 'pool with water slide', 'pool with lap lanes', 'private pool', and hotels with 'water park' or 'lazy river'. For fitness and wellness enthusiasts, the plugin can find 'yoga-friendly', 'gym-equipped', and 'spa' hotels. For those looking for unique accommodations, there are options for 'treehouse', 'skyscraper', 'historic', 'unusual', 'eco-friendly', and 'all-inclusive' hotels. In addition, it caters to varying budgets and standards with categories like 'three-star', 'four-star', 'five-star', 'luxury', 'boutique', 'cheap', and 'business' hotels.\n\nThis is the full list of 60 categories available on Travelmyth. Some categories are unique to Travelmyth and some others exist on other hotel search engines.\nHoneymoon Hotels\nSmall Hotels\nHistoric Hotels\nCastle Hotels\nMonastery Hotels\nSpa Hotels\nGolf Hotels\nHotels with Treehouse rooms\nEco Friendly Hotels\nBeachfront Hotels\nInfinity Pool Hotels\nVineyard Hotels\n5 Star Hotels\nSkyscraper Hotels\nCasino Hotels\nLuxury Hotels\nUnusual Hotels\nSki In Ski Out Hotels\nAccessible Hotels\nBoutique-Style Hotels\nAdult Only Hotels\nFamily Friendly Hotels\nDog Friendly Hotels\nBudget Hotels\nRomantic Hotels\nNightlife Hotels\nSki Hotels\nHotels near the Beach\nHotels with Tennis Court\nYoga Hotels\nHaunted Hotels\nBusiness Hotels\nFour Star Hotels\nThree Star Hotels\nHotels with Free WiFi\nHotels with Parking\nHotels with Gym\nHotels with Pool\nOverwater Bungalows\nHotels with Heated Pool\nHotels with Indoor Pool\nHotels with Rooftop Pool\nHotels with Wave Pool\nHotels with Children Pool\nHotels with Panoramic View Pool\nHotels with Pool Swim Up Bar\nHotels with Pool Water Slide\nHotels with Pool Lap Lanes\nHotels with Water Park\nHotels with Lazy River\nHotels with Private Pool\nHotels with Dog Play Area\nHotels with Dog Sitting Service\nHotels where Dogs Stay Free\nHotels with Outdoor Pool\nHotels that have taken extra Health & Safety mea\nHotels with with EV charging stations\nHotels with rooms with jacuzzi / hot-tub\nHotels with rooms with fireplace\nHotels with all inclusive packages\n\nThe plugin operates based on the OpenAPI specification and uses the GET method to fetch hotel information, including name, star rating, guest rating, average nightly price, photo, description, and categories of each hotel. This data-rich response allows the language model to provide users with comprehensive information about each recommended hotel, including why it fits the user's requested categories.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the plugin does not initiate search or booking processes unless explicitly requested by the user. Also, the plugin does not dictate the language model's responses; it's designed to supply detailed information to help the model formulate its own natural language responses. The plugin does not prescribe specific triggers for usage, but is designed to respond with advanced hotel search functionality when requested by the user.\nMoreover, the plugin is designed with user safety and privacy in mind. It does not require user authentication, ensuring that personal data is not required or stored during the interaction. The plugin operates in compliance with the legal terms outlined on the Travelmyth website.\n\nThe integration of this plugin with ChatGPT opens up a new frontier in the user's hotel search experience, allowing them to find the most suitable hotels based on a variety of criteria that go beyond the usual filters. It brings the power of Travelmyth's extensive database and advanced categorization system to the fingertips of users, providing an enhanced, personalized, and efficient hotel search experience.",
